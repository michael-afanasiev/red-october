Just a little thing that does some stuff

Driver.py calls a bunch of things in the cubit_com class. Should be more or less self explanatory with the documentation, but give me a shout if it's not.

You'll need to put the cubit python module into your path. On the workstation here it should be in /opt/Trelis-15.0/bin. 

For visualizing, I'm exporting an exodus file as well. This can be read natively by paraview.
